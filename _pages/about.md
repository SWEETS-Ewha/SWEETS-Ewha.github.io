Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Welcome to **SWEETS Lab.** at Ewha Womans University!

Software exists everywhere in our lives. If software behaves unexpectedly,
specifically unreliably or insecurely, the consequences can be severe. Thus, to
make our lives **sweeter**, we need to make efforts to improve software
_reliability_ and _security_.

Our lab interests on investigating software being developed and already deployed
in the wild to identify reliability and security issues. In particular, our
research topics lie in the following areas:

- **Software Analysis** for understanding software behaviors,
- **Software Testing** for detecting software unreliability bugs, and
- **Software Security** for identifying software security vulnerabilities.

We welcome motivated undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in
these research topics. If you are interested, please refer to the
<a href='/Opening/'>opening page</a>.
