We are looking for motivated undergraduate and graduate students to join our
lab. Life in an academic lab will be very rewarding as you will contribute to
creating new knowledge and technologies that do not exist yet in the world.
Prof. Soomin Kim will do his best to guide you throughout your research journey.

### What you will do

You will have opportunities to:

#### As an undergraduate intern

- Develop software tools or techniques for binary code analysis
- Find and report functional and security bugs in real-world software systems
- Participate in hacking competitions
- Conduct academic research

Your goal is to be familiar with the process of academic research through
various hands-on activities. Not just doing these activities, you will
eventually write a research paper targetting a variety of conferences, ranging
from domestic conferences to top-tier international conferences depending on
your achievements.

#### As a graduate student

- Conduct academic research related to binary code analysis, software testing,
  software security, and more (based on your interest)

Your goal is to become an independent researcher who can come up with novel
research ideas and solve problems in software engineering. We will always target
top-tier international conferences and journals for publishing our research
outcomes.

### Who can apply?

For undergraduate interns, we prefer students who wish to continue their studies
in our lab as a graduate student. However, even if you have a different future
plan, it is always a good idea to apply for the internship position.

For graduate students from other departments or univerisities, we recommend that
you consult with Prof. Kim at least one semester before applying for the
graduate school. However, this is not a mandatory requirement, so feel free to
reach out to him anytime.

### How to apply

If you are interested in joining our SWEETS Lab, please send an email to Prof.
Kim (soomink.ewha@gmail.com) with the following information:

- CV (free format)
- Academic transcript
- A brief statement of purpose describing why you want to join our lab (max 1
  page, in your preferred language), including
  - your interest topics in software engineering
  - your previous research or project experience (if any)
  - and your future plans.

Then Prof. Kim will get back to you as soon as possible.

### Want to know about our lab more?

Don't hesitate to contact Prof. Kim if you have any questions about our lab. One
specific request is please do send an email directly to Prof. Kim instead of
contacting through other lab members. This is both for you and our lab members'
convenience. Thank you!
