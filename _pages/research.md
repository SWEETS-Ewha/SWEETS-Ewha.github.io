### Binary Code Analysis

Binary code analysis aims to understand the structure and behavior of binary
code. Analyzing binary code is worthwhile because the original source code and
the resulting binary code can have different meanings due to compiler
optimizations. The primary challenge in binary code analysis is the loss of
high-level source code information during the compilation process.

Our lab is interested in the following research directions:

- Building a binary code analysis framework
- Developing foundational techniques for binary code analysis
- Analyzing non-traditional architectures
- Applying binary code analysis to real-world problems
- Reverse engineering of neural networks

### Fuzzing

Fuzzing, or fuzz testing, is an automated software testing technqiue that
involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to software.
Because of its effectiveness in discovering bugs and easy applicability, fuzzing
has become a popular technique for software testing and security. The main
challenge in fuzzing is to enhance the performance of fuzzers in terms of either
testing effectiveness or efficiency.

Our lab has interests in the following research topics:

- Suggesting novel technqiues for building blocks of fuzzers
- Devising new fuzzing techniques for specific domains
- Incorporating machine learning techniques into fuzzing

### Offensive Security

Based on the above research directions, our lab also have interests in offensive
security, which automatically finds and exploits vulnerabilities in software
systems. By doing so, our goal is to make software systems more secure to
prevent and mitigate potential attacks.

- Developing novel techniques for automatic vulnerability discovery
- Devising new methods for automatic exploit generation
- Realizing offensive security techniques through Capture-The-Flag (CTF)
